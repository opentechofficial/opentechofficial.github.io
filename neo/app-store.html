<h3>P2P App Store</h3>
<p>
The P2P app store will use the dat protocol to seed apps to users, this enables two things: 1. the apps are verified via hash, 2. developers don't need to pay a server for users to download their app, and 3. the more popular an app the faster download speeds will be, this also means that apps cannot be censored.
</p>
<h4>Rating</h4>
<p>
The app store will have a system of star rating, each app will have two ratings, one regular rating, and a second security rating, the first 100 users of the app will be required to rate the app, after 48 hours of use, otherwise they won't be able to use the app, this ensures two things, 1. widespread apps all have at least 100 ratings, and 2. insecure apps, will appear less in app search results.
