<h3>GuiLang</h3>
<p>
GuiLang is the XML based language used to create interfaces or GUIs for apps in Neo OS.
GuiLang comes with many tags and each tag can have an id, <code>id="myID"</code>
this allows AppLang to reference an element in it's code. GuiLang elements all have positions,
widths and heights, and positions are always based on the center of the element.
GuiLang also has helpers for positions such as, <code> center </code> which has the value of
the center point in a given view. There is also <code>full</code> which is the width/height of a given view.
Once the main GuiLang file has been created, we can make new ones to specify other windows, which we can reference directly in
GuiLang, and display from the main view without having to use AppLang.
