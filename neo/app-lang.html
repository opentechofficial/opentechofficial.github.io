<h1>Neo OS</h1>

<h3>AppLang</h3>
<p>
AppLang is used to make a GuiLang window interactive, for example, by referencing buttons, and executing code when a button is
pressed. Something to note though is that unlike most programming languages, AppLang doesn't execute anything, it sends messages
to Neo OS's message bus which then get executed by the OS. This means that if an app is locked, none of this code can get
executed it also means that there will be no errors, as if it doesn't execute, then nothing will happen, this also means that
if the app needs to do something potentially dangerous, instead of directly asking the user for root permissions, and potentially
displaying misinformation to trick the user into putting his password, in order for the app do do something bad, tha app simply
says what it wants to do, and the OS, displays a window for the user to put in a password that tells the user exactly what the app
wants to do.
