<h1>Neo OS</h1>

<h3>App Locks</h3>
<p>
Windows in Neo OS have a lock in the top right corner, this effectively allows "locking" the app. Now if you read up on the message bus, you'll see apps in Neo OS, cannot do anything to files, hardware, or other apps, by themselves, they send a message to the os in the message bus, where the os inspects the requests for security, and executes the actions itself, resulting in a higher security. The app-lock simply sets tags on the app, which signal to Neo OS that it is not allowed to connect to the internet, cannot open files, edit files, or perform any action apart from what is already in the current scope.
