    <p>Hello, and welcome to my new series, BrokenInternet. Here I'll cover existing vulnerabilities and issues with our modern day internet.</p>
    
    <h3>Why I created this Series</h3>
    <p>
    Today more and more devices are connected to the internet, more of our data is t]stored there, and more and more hacks happen, this incites users of the internet to check how secure this platform that all their devices use, really is. From DDOS attacks to data leakage, our privacy is now more than ever at stake, and with the power of corporations and governmental organisations, it is now almost impossible to use the internet, without having to give data to these companies.
    
    Furthermore, users often blindly trust that the system they are utilising is secure, and that corporations respect your privacy, when most of the time neither of these assumptions are the case.
    </p>
    <h3>What will the next post be about?</h3>
    <p>
    The next post BrokenInternet[1] = "LAN & Local Vulnerabilities" will touch on a subject rarely discussed in terms of internet security which is your LAN network and router with which you connect to the internet, and how vulnerable this ancient system is.
